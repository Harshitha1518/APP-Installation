Use ubuntu servers for both master and slave.

1) Update the new server by running -- sudo apt update
2)  install java -- sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk -y
3) install wget – sudo apt install wget
3) Download the Jenkins package  -- sudo wget -O /etc/apt/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc   https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
4) Run this command --  echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc]"   https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
5) Once again update the server packages --  sudo apt-get update
6) Install Jenkins – sudo apt-get install Jenkins
